\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	% a screenshot in which you show values (right click, Value) for ensembles 
	% a, b, and c, while running your model and varying the stimulus, 
	% demonstrating the effects of the various connections that you made.
	
	\item A screenshot of the values of ensembles \textbf{a}, \textbf{b} and \textbf{c} can be found at \hyperref[fig:1a]{Figure~\ref{fig:1a}}. 
	
	Note that ensembles \textbf{a} and \textbf{b} react to changes rather quickly, while ensemble \textbf{c} adjusts more slowly. This is due to the fact that the synaptic constant is set to its default value (5ms) for the connections \emph{stimulus~$\rightarrow$~a}, \emph{a~$\rightarrow$~b} and \emph{b~$\rightarrow$~c}, whereas the connection used to create the simple memory, \emph{c~$\rightarrow$~c}, has a synaptic constant set at 100ms.
	
	% a screenshot of the tuning curves of ensemble a (right click on a,
	% Detailsâ€¦, Plots). Explain what those tuning curves indicate.
	\item A screenshot of the tuning curves of ensemble \textbf{a} can be found at \hyperref[fig:1b]{Figure~\ref{fig:1b}}.
	
	The tuning curves represent at which value of $x$ (the input) the neurons respond most frequently. In order to give a good representation of the input value as the output value, many neurons are tuned to different ``sections'' of the range of the input value, in a way ``specializing'' in recognizing a specific value and firing most often when their value is the input value. This means that together, the neurons will generate a value that will resemble the input value, as there are 100 neurons -- which is plenty to represent a range from -1 to 1.
	
	% Set the stimulus to 0. Explain the pattern that you see in the value
	% displays of a, b, and c.
	\item 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ensemble \textbf{a} has the same value as the stimulus.
			\item Ensemble \textbf{b} has a value of $-0.5$, because the connection a~$\rightarrow$~b uses the function \texttt{centered\_square(a)} which takes the value in \texttt{a} and applies the function $(a*a-0.5)$. $0*0-0.5 = 0.5$
			\item Ensemble \textbf{c} has a value of around $-1.1$. This is because the input to c remains non-zero, causing the integrator (i.e. the simple memory) to saturate quickly, meaning it will tend to its extreme value.
